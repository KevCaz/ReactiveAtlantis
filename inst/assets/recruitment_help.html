<h2>Summary Recruit and YOY page</h2>
<p>This code Helps to calibrate the recruitment for <b>Atlantis</b> based on the recruitment and allows you to test new values</p>
<p><b>Rec_model</b> Recruitment model used for the functional group</p>
<p><b>Alpha</b> Current value of Alpha ( on the .prm file)</p>
<p><b>Beta</b> Current value of Alpha ( on the .prm file)</p>
<p><b>Initial YOY</b> Initial value of Young of the Year (YOY) for this functional groups reported in the 'yoy.file'
    Atlantis output</p>
<p><b>New Alpha</b> You can put a new value for Alpha and calculate a new YOY for that new value</p>
<p><b>New Beta</b> You can put a new value for Beta and calculate a new YOY for that new value</p>
<h4>Outputs</h4>
<p><b>Plot 1</b> YOY and Larvaes calculated for ATLANTIS; new larvae and new YOY values calculated using <b>New
        Alpha</b> and <b>New Beta</b> values </p>
<p><b>Plot 2</b> Proportion of the YOY compared with the initial value YOY<sub>0</sub></p>
<p><b>Table</b> Output from both plots by each reproduction period</p>
<h2>Summary Growth Zooplankton and Primary producer</h2>
<p><b>Functional group 1 </b> and <b>Functional group 2</b> allow you to highlight the FGs on the plots</p>
<p><b>Box</b> Select the box that you are interested</p>
<p><b>Layer-Proportion</b> Each time series on the plot is scaled between 0 and 1 in each layer (divided by the highest
    value of the time series on that specific layer and box) (<i>Default = TRUE</i>)</p>
<p><b>Box-Proportion</b> Each time series on the plot is scaled between 0 and 1 (divided by the highest value of the
    time series on that box) (<i>Default = FALSE</i>)</p>
<p><b>Logarithm</b> Logarithm of the time series(<i>Default = FALSE</i>)</p>
<h4>Outputs</h4>
<p>One Plot for layer with the time series of <b><i>Zooplankton</i></b>, <b><i>Primary Producers</i></b>,
    <b><i>Light</i></b> and <b><i>Eddies</i></b>
